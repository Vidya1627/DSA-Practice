# DSA Practice

Welcome to the **DSA Practice** repository! This repository contains all the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems I am solving as part of my practice. The solutions are implemented in **C++**, and I am continuously adding new problems. These questions will help you become **interview-ready**.

## Repository Structure

- Problems are organized into **individual files**.
- Each file includes the following sections:
  - **Problem Statement**
  - **Explanation**
  - **C++ Solution**
- Some problems have **multiple approaches** for better understanding.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vidya1627/DSA-Practice.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository**
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Practice
   ```

3. **Compile a Solution**
   ```bash
   g++ <filename>.cpp -o output
   ```

4. **Run the Compiled Program**
   ```bash
