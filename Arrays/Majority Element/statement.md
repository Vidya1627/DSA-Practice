# Problem: Majority Element
[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

## Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the **majority element**.

The **majority element** is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times.  
You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Constraints
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `-10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`
